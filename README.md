# PySpark Local

Minimal implementation of the PySpark API to make it easier to write and locally test PySpark code. You can run your PySpark code against this local API to verify it works with sample data before using the real PySpark API in production.

## Getting Started

Copy `pyspark.py` into the same directory with your own Python files.
